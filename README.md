[COMPLETE] How does a dominant grass respond to a gradient of water?

•	Important plant species within ecological communities (dominant species) use intraspecific trait variation to maintain function under both optimal and stressful conditions. Yet, few studies of intraspecific diversity in natural populations account for nonlinear plasticity, variation in plastic traits across a gradient of conditions.
•	We investigated the intraspecific trait differences, plasticity, and nonlinearities in plasticity under a controlled water availability gradient. We applied these concepts in the context of future climate change with three genotypes of Andropogon gerardii, the dominant warm-season grass of the North American tallgrass prairie. This ecosystem is likely to face more extreme and frequent droughts in the future.
•	Nonlinear plasticity in morphological and physiological traits was widespread and differed across genotypes, highlighting the influence of relatively small changes in water availability on intraspecific diversity. Genotypes also differed in reproductive strategy, but all recovered similarly following drought. 
•	For the first time, we demonstrate that nonlinear plasticity may help explain intraspecific diversity and patterns of selection within a population. A better understanding of intraspecific diversity and trait variation in this grass species will provide more mechanistic insight into its ability to moderate community changes in the tallgrass prairie under future droughts.
